# ⚡ Quick Upstash Redis Setup (2 Minutes)

## What Changed?

✅ **Fixed**: Deprecated `@vercel/kv` warning resolved
✅ **Upgraded**: Now using `@upstash/redis` (official Vercel recommendation)
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing `KV_*` environment variables
✅ **Same functionality**: Visitor counter works exactly the same

## 🚀 Setup Steps (After Deployment)

### 1. Install Upstash Redis Integration

**Via Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Go to your project on Vercel
2. Click **"Storage"** tab
3. Click **"Create Database"** → Select **"Upstash Redis"**
4. Or visit: https://vercel.com/marketplace/upstash-redis
5. Click **"Add Integration"**
6. Select your portfolio project
7. Name: `portfolio-visitors`
8. Region: Choose closest to you
9. Click **"Create"**

**Done!** Environment variables are automatically added:
- `KV_REST_API_URL` (works with our code!)
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` (works with our code!)
- Plus: `KV_URL` and `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`

**Note**: Our code supports both `KV_*` (legacy) and `UPSTASH_REDIS_*` (new) variable names.

### 2. Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Redeploy"** on latest deployment
3. Wait 2 minutes

### 3. Verify

Visit your portfolio → Check footer → Visitor counter should show real numbers!

## 📋 Environment Variables Needed

Your portfolio now needs these **11 variables** in Vercel:

### Already Added (from before):
1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`
2. `SMTP_HOST`
3. `SMTP_PORT`
4. `SMTP_SECURE`
5. `SMTP_USER`
6. `SMTP_PASS`
7. `SMTP_FROM`
8. `ADMIN_EMAIL`
9. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

### New (Auto-added by Upstash integration):
10. `KV_REST_API_URL` (or `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`)
11. `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` (or `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`)

**Note**: Upstash adds `KV_*` names by default. Our code supports both naming conventions!

## 🎯 What Happens Without Redis?

If you don't setup Redis, the visitor counter will show **fallback demo numbers**:
- 19 unique visitors
- 47 total visits
- 3 today's visitors

The site works perfectly, but won't track real visitors.

---

## 💰 Cost

**FREE** for portfolios!
- 10,000 commands/day (supports 1,000-2,000 visitors/day)
- No credit card required
- More than enough for personal portfolios
